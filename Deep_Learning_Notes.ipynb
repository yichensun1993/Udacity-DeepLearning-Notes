    "\n",
    "We have to be very careful about [overfitting](http://machinelearningmastery.com/overfitting-and-underfitting-with-machine-learning-algorithms/) on test set, so use the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "And when the validation set is small, when we tweak our model, the accuracy might change, but this could just be noise. And a useful rule of thumb is that, a change that affects 30 examples in your validation set, one way or another, is usually statistically significant and typically can be trusted. \n",
    "\n",
    "As 30 in 3000 is a 1% change, people tend to hold back 30,000 examples for validation, which makes the accuracy figures significant to the first decimal place and gives enough resolution to see small improvements. However, if my classes are not well-balanced and some classes are very rare compared to others, this heuristic is no longer good and more data would be needed. This means we need to hold back more than 30,000 data in training set, which is already a great amount, especially for some small training sets. In this case, cross-validation is one possible way to mitigate the issue but might take more time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training logistic regression with gradient descent is a good trial as we are directly optimizing the error measure that we care about, and that is why in practice lots of ML research is about designing the right lost function to optimize. However, the biggest problem is that it is very difficult to scale. When larger dataset is fed in, the calculation would become humongous, and that is why we are using stochastic gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Stochastic Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "If calculating loss function takes n floating point operations, computing its gradient takes about three times that compute. And for now, our loss function is already huge and depends on every element in the training set, so we are going to cheat.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will compute an estimate of the loss instead the loss itself. The estimate is simply computing the average loss for a very small random fraction of the training data, between 1 and 1000 training samples each time. (In fact, this estimate is so terrible that we have to use measures to make it less terrible.) This S.G.D is actually at the heart of deep learning because it can be efficiently scaled both with data and model size, which is exactly the big data and big models we are dealing with. But still, we need to solve a lot of issues coming with this rough estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some measures we used to help SGD is listed below:\n",
    "1. Inputs\n",
    "    1. zero mean\n",

    "2. Initial weights\n",

    "\n",
    "We can refer from previous random steps because that on aggregate, those steps take us towards the minimum of loss. To keep a running average of the gradients and use this running average instead of the direction of the current batch of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For the traditional gradient descent, its gradient $\\Delta L$ and step direction $-\\alpha\\Delta L(w_i)$\n",
    "2. For the momentum technique, its gradient $\\Delta L + 0.9M$ and step direction $-\\alpha M(w_i)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This momentum technique works well and often leads to better convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Rate Decay\n",
    "\n",
    "As we are using SGD, we are taking smaller and noisier steps towards our objective. Besides all that still need to be researched on, making steps smaller and smaller as we train is usually beneficial. (There are many ways to determine this decaying learning rates, for example, we can lower the learning rate when the loss reach a plateau or simply use a exponential decay function to characterize it.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We might once tend to believe larger learning rates lead to faster learning; however, that is not true. High learning rates start the learning faster but then plateaus, while lower learning rates keep going and get better.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for SGD, we have many hyperparameters to play with:\n",
    "1. initial learning rate\n",
    "2. learning rate decay\n",
    "3. momentum\n",
    "4. batch size\n",
    "5. weight initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to make these parameters right to make the neural network learn, but when things don't work, try to lower the learning rate first.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are similar measures like **AdaGrad**, which is a modififation of SGD which implicitly does momentum and learning rate decay. This will make tuning hyperparameters easier but the performance tends to be a little worse than precisely tuned SGD with momentum. At last, we need to remember we are still dealing with a linear model and no deep learning is into the play.\n",

    "# Mini-batch\n",

    "Mini-batching is a technique for training on subsets of the dataset instead of all the data at one time. This provides the ability to train a model, even if a computer lacks the memory to store the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mini-batching is computationally inefficient, since you can't calculate the loss simultaneously across all samples. However, this is a small price to pay in order to be able to run the model at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also quite useful combined with SGD. The idea is to randomly shuffle the data at the start of each epoch, then create the mini-batches. For each mini-batch, you train the network weights with gradient descent. Since these batches are random, you're performing SGD with each batch.\n",
